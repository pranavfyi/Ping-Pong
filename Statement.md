Problem Statement
Create a functional two-player Pong game using Python where players control paddles to hit a moving ball. The system must detect collisions, update scores, reset the ball after misses, and run smoothly in real time using the Turtle graphics library.

Scope of the Project
Build a complete playable Pong game.
Implement paddle movement, ball physics, scoring, and collision mechanics.
Use a modular structure with multiple Python files.
Display real-time score updates and maintain consistent game flow.
Keep the gameplay responsive and visually simple.

Target Users
Students learning Python fundamentals.
Beginners exploring game development or OOP concepts.
Anyone looking for a simple interactive Python project.


High-Level Features
Two-player paddle controls.
Continuous ball movement with bounce logic.
Paddle and wall collision detection.
Scoreboard that updates dynamically.
Clean modular code: main.py, paddle.py, ball.py, scoreboard.py.
